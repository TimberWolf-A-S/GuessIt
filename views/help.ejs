      <p id="helpP">In order to play the game, you will first enter a username and choose a room number in the lobby. If you are a
        premade team, you will need to chose the same room number, in order to be able to play together. You will only be able to start the game when you are between 2 - 4 players connected to the chat.
        <br><br><strong>Game play</strong><br>When the game starts, all players, except for one, will be able to see an image and the name of the person, animal, etc. on the image. These people are known as helpers throughout the game. The last player will be known as the guesser, and they cannot see the picture or hints. It is the helpers job to come with hints through the chat about the identity of the person or animal on the picture. <strong>It is not allowed to write the correct word in the chat if you are the helper</strong>. Through the hints from the helper, the guesser can type in the name of the word in the chat, as long as there is still time left. If the person guesses correctly they will receive 50 points, otherwise, they will not receive any points. The correct word is case-sensitive.
